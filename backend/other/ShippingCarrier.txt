Select a Shipping Carrier:

Choose a reliable shipping carrier that provides tracking services. Major carriers like UPS, FedEx, DHL, and national postal services often offer tracking solutions.
Integrate Shipping APIs:

Integrate the application programming interfaces (APIs) provided by your chosen shipping carriers into your ecommerce platform. These APIs allow you to retrieve real-time tracking information.
Order Status Updates:

Update the order status in your ecommerce system as it progresses through the shipping process. Common statuses include "Order Received," "Processing," "Shipped," and "Delivered."
Customer Notifications:

Set up automated email or SMS notifications to keep customers informed about their order status. Inform them when the order is shipped and provide a tracking number.
Tracking Number Link:

Include a link to the carrier's tracking page in the customer's order history or confirmation email. This allows customers to easily access the tracking information.
Admin Dashboard:

Create a dashboard for administrators to track the status of all orders. This can be useful for customer service and order management.
Mobile App Integration:

If you have a mobile app, integrate the tracking functionality into it so that customers can check their order status on the go.
Real-Time Updates:

Ensure that tracking information is updated in real-time. This requires regular communication with the shipping carrier's API to fetch the latest data.
Delivery Confirmation:

If possible, integrate features for delivery confirmation. Some carriers provide delivery confirmation notifications or signatures, which can be important for the release of funds from escrow in your system.
Exceptions Handling:

Implement a system to handle exceptions, such as delays or failed delivery attempts. Notify customers of any issues and provide instructions on what to do next.
Testing:

Test the tracking functionality thoroughly to ensure it works as expected. Consider doing real-world tests with a small group of users before a full-scale launch.
Continuous Improvement:

Regularly update and improve your tracking system based on customer feedback and any changes in the services provided by your chosen shipping carriers.
Remember that the specific steps and details may vary depending on the ecommerce platform you are using and the APIs provided by your chosen shipping carriers. Consult the documentation of your ecommerce platform and the APIs for more detailed and platform-specific guidance.
