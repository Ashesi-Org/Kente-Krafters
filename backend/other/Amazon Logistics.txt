Amazon Logistics:

Amazon has its own logistics network, known as Amazon Logistics. This allows the company to have more control over the delivery process. Amazon can track packages, provide real-time updates, and take immediate action if any issues arise during the delivery.
Delivery Tracking:

Customers can track their orders in real-time through the Amazon website or mobile app. This transparency helps customers know the status of their delivery and ensures they are informed throughout the process.
